3. In 2020, I graduated from BSUIR, Faculty of Computer Design, with a degree in electronic security systems design engineer. But I decided to connect my life with web development. Independently studied HTML, CSS. He took courses from the it-academy "Website development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript" and received a corresponding certificate. I'm going to continue to develop in this direction. Now I study JS myself and take courses from the it-academy "Developing web applications in JavaScriptÂ».

            let result = "";
            
            for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
                let number = "";

                while (!isNaN(str[i + 1])) {
                    number += str[i + 1];
                    i++;
                } 

                if (str.length == 1) {
                    result = str;
                } else {
                    result += str[i - number.length].repeat(number);
                }

                number = "";
            }

            console.log(`"${str}" => "${result}"`);
